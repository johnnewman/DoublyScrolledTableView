DoublyScrolledTableView
=======================

DoublyScrolledTableView was the spawn of a very boring Wednesday afternoon.  Wanted to see how challenging it would be to create a grid that's horizontally and vertically scrollable.

I think with some work to make it a bit more modular, it has some potential.

The gif example doesn't do it justice because it can't capture the proper framerate.  I promise it's smooth!  Also, I don't know what I was thinking calling that the "corn lbl" (for corner), but I kept it because I think it's hilarious.
